### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dean. I'm a Ruby on Rails developer based in the UK. I've been working with Ruby for 10 years and have built and maintained hundreds of Rails apps over that time. I also maintain and administer multiple Linux servers.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deanpcmad) or you can view my site at [deanpcmad.com](https://deanpcmad.com)

My current projects are:

- [Florence Bot](https://deanpcmad.com/florencebot/) - A Twitch chat bot and game giveaway system
- TwitchRB (WIP & not open source yet) - A RubyGem for interacting with both the Twitch.tv Kraken and Helix APIs
- PaddleRB (WIP & not open source yet) - A RubyGem for interacting with the Paddle.com API
- TTVAPI (WIP & not open source yet) - A Rails app which gives streamers easy ways to access Twitch APIs such as their subscriber count
- StreamVODs (Currently in private beta) - A service which allows streamers to upload their YouTube videos and show then with Twitch chat, as they would do on the Twitch site but stored forever
- Secret Project (Currently in development) - A service for streamers for creating alerts and taking donations

I've worked on / helped maintain a number of open source projects such as:

- [ror_ecommerce](drhenner/ror_ecommerce)
  - I helped to maintain this project by checking pull requests and merging as required
  - Migrated the admin area design to ZURB Foundation
- [shoppe](tryshoppe/shoppe)
  - I helped to maintain this project by checking pull requests and merging as required
  - Also helped by adding new features

I've written a few different RubyGems:

- [codebase_api](https://rubygems.org/gems/codebase_api) - A wrapper for accessing the Codebase (codebasehq.com) API
- [shoppe-paypal](https://rubygems.org/gems/shoppe-paypal) - A plugin for Shoppe, an ecommerce Rails engine (which I also helped maintain), which adds support for taking payments with PayPal
