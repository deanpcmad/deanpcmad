### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dean. I'm a Ruby on Rails developer based in the UK. I've been working with Ruby for 10 years and have built and maintained hundreds of Rails apps over that time. I also maintain and administer multiple Linux servers.

If you like my work, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/deanpcmad) - every coffee is really appreciated!

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deanpcmad) or you can view my site at [deanpcmad.com](https://deanpcmad.com)

My current projects are:

- [Florence Bot](https://deanpcmad.com/florencebot/) - A Twitch chat bot and game giveaway system
- [TwitchRB](https://github.com/deanpcmad/twitchrb) (WIP) - A RubyGem for interacting with both the Twitch Helix and Kraken APIs
- [StreamVODs](https://streamvods.com) - A service which allows streamers to upload their YouTube videos and show then with Twitch chat, as they would do on the Twitch site but stored forever
- Secret Project (Currently in development) - A service for streamers for creating alerts and taking donations
- BillyRB (WIP & not open source yet) - A Rails engine for Stripe Subscription billing
- TTVAPI (WIP & not open source yet) - A Rails app which gives streamers easy ways to access Twitch APIs such as their subscriber count

I've worked on / helped maintain a number of open source projects such as:

  - Migrated the admin area design to ZURB Foundation
